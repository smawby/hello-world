git clone https://github.com/smawby/hello-world

You need to "add" before every commit, unlike SVN
* Add first
* git status to check
* Then commit, with message
Be careful when adding with MLAB IDE: you shouldn't add the entire project directory; 
only the files that have changed and that you want to commit.

If you need to remove files from the repository later, first see http://microchipdeveloper.com/faq:72
* git rm --cached [filename] removes files from repository, but does not delete the local copies.


To upload a project, see https://gist.github.com/mindplace/b4b094157d7a3be6afd2c96370d39fad :
* Make repository on github
* git remote add origin [github URL]
* git push origin master (this is also part of the standard workflow to push files to GitHub)
